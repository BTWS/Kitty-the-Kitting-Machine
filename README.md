# Kitty, the Kitting Machine

Kitty is a modular system to make kits semi-automatic with an emphasis on small parts. Kitty is a combination of a counting machine and an evolution of an old-fashioned component cabinet. These are most monotonous handlings and straightforward to automate. With different laser-cut templates screws, but also nuts, bearings and small ABS parts can be automatically counted to the correct amount and be provided a cup.
